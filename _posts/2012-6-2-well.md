title: About

# CaleX


The idea behind this simple web application is taken from [Jerry Seinfield](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret), where he describes his technique of writing jokes. He marks an X on a calendar for each day he has written a new joke with the aim of having a chain of X's. He then gets addicted to not breaking the chain, which forces him to write more jokes. 

Personally, my daily activities are going to be:

1. Play at least 10 minutes of Ukelele
2. Commit at least one change in any of the projects I am working on
3. Jot down at least a sentence for a blog post
